I-Data Entry
  Each employee can select his preferred currency. 
  At the end of each week, employees must report the amount of worked hours.
  The application can create the Payments Report only when all employees has reported their Worked Hours. Zero (worked hours) is a valid value.


II-Payments Report
  The output must be a report (printed to the screen), or a file containing all payments. The report must have the following information (the final format is up to you):
       * Header: Full Date and Time, Total amount in the Base Currency, and Current Exchange Rates
       * Each entry: Entry number, Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Currency Code, Amount, Amount Base Currency$
       * Footer: Full Date and Time, Total amount in the Base Currency, Sub-Total by Currency

  Sample Report (assuming the Base Currency is DOP), USD to DOP is $30 DOP by $1 USD:

       Total USD:   $300.00
       Total DOP: $5,000.00
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


III-Exchange Rates
  Before you can produce the Payments Report, you need to know the exchange rates between the Base Currency (Dominican Peso - DOP) and the other currencies (USR, EUR). See below how to get that data.

  Exchange Rates from Yahoo Finance API
    The following URL (using GET), will bring you the exchange rates from DOP to USD and EUR.
      http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("DOPEUR", "DOPUSD")&env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys&format=json

    The job (query), is done by the following URL parameter
      select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("DOPEUR", "DOPUSD")

    Example: if you need the exchange rate between Mexican Peso and US Dollar you write the following query
      select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("MXNUSD"), the final URL will look like this
        http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select * from yahoo.finance.xchange where pair in ("MXNUSD")&env=store://datatables.org/alltableswithkeys&format=json

    Sample Result
      {
        query: {
          count: 6,
          created: "2015-03-03T15:24:30Z",
          lang: "en-US",
          results: {
            rate: [
              {
                id: "DOPEUR",
                Name: "DOP to EUR",
                Rate: "0.02",
                Date: "3/3/2015",
                Time: "10:24am",
                Ask: "0.02",
                Bid: "0.0199"
              },
              {
                id: "DOPUSD",
                Name: "DOP to USD",
                Rate: "0.0223",
                Date: "3/3/2015",
                Time: "10:23am",
                Ask: "0.0224",
                Bid: "0.0223"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }

  The rate is read like this: To convert from DOP to USD you must multiply the DOP amount by 0.0223 (Bid). If you have DOP$100.00 to get USD do: 100 x 0.0223 = USD$2.23


IV-Persistence
  If you need to persist any data element (User details, Old Reports, etc), use text files with JSON format.
